FFUF (Fuzz Faster U Fool) offers several filter options to refine the results of fuzzing. Filters help you focus on relevant findings by eliminating responses that match certain criteria. Here's a detailed breakdown of FFUF filter options with examples:

---

### **Common FFUF Filter Options**
1. **`-fc` (Filter by Status Code)**  
   Excludes responses with specific HTTP status codes.  
   - **Example**:  
     ```bash
     ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -fc 404
     ```
     Excludes results with a 404 (Not Found) status code.

   - **Multiple Status Codes**:  
     ```bash
     ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -fc 403,404,500
     ```
     Filters out 403, 404, and 500 status codes.

---

2. **`-mc` (Match by Status Code)**  
   Includes only responses with specific HTTP status codes.  
   - **Example**:  
     ```bash
     ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -mc 200
     ```
     Displays only responses with a 200 (OK) status code.

   - **Multiple Status Codes**:  
     ```bash
     ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -mc 200,301,302
     ```
     Displays responses with status codes 200, 301, or 302.

---

3. **`-fs` (Filter by Response Size)**  
   Excludes responses with a specific size (in bytes).  
   - **Example**:  
     ```bash
     ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -fs 0
     ```
     Filters out responses with a size of 0 bytes (empty responses).

   - **Range Filtering** (not supported directly, but you can chain runs):  
     Combine with tools like `grep` if filtering by a range is needed.

---

4. **`-ms` (Match by Response Size)**  
   Includes only responses with a specific size.  
   - **Example**:  
     ```bash
     ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -ms 1234
     ```
     Displays only responses that are 1234 bytes in size.

---

5. **`-fw` (Filter by Word Count)**  
   Excludes responses with a specific word count.  
   - **Example**:  
     ```bash
     ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -fw 5
     ```
     Filters out responses with exactly 5 words.

---

6. **`-mw` (Match by Word Count)**  
   Includes only responses with a specific word count.  
   - **Example**:  
     ```bash
     ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -mw 20
     ```
     Displays only responses with 20 words.

---

7. **`-fl` (Filter by Line Count)**  
   Excludes responses with a specific number of lines.  
   - **Example**:  
     ```bash
     ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -fl 10
     ```
     Filters out responses that have exactly 10 lines.

---

8. **`-ml` (Match by Line Count)**  
   Includes only responses with a specific number of lines.  
   - **Example**:  
     ```bash
     ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -ml 15
     ```
     Displays only responses that have 15 lines.

---

9. **Combining Filters**  
   Multiple filters can be combined to refine results further.  
   - **Example**:  
     ```bash
     ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -fc 404 -fs 0 -fw 5
     ```
     Excludes:
     - Responses with a 404 status code.
     - Responses with 0 bytes.
     - Responses with 5 words.

---

### **Practical Scenarios**
#### **1. Finding Only Valid Directories**
- Goal: Display only directories with status code 200.  
  - Command:
    ```bash
    ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ/ -w wordlist.txt -mc 200 -ml 10
    ```

#### **2. Identifying Hidden Admin Panels**
- Goal: Ignore 404 pages and focus on responses with unique content.  
  - Command:
    ```bash
    ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -fc 404 -fs 0
    ```

#### **3. Recursive Fuzzing with Filters**
- Goal: Find directories recursively, filtering out 403 errors.  
  - Command:
    ```bash
    ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -recursion -recursion-depth 2 -fc 403
    ```

By using FFUF's filters strategically, you can cut through noise and focus on results that matter most during fuzzing.




FFUF (Fuzz Faster U Fool) is a powerful tool for web fuzzing, often used to discover directories, files, parameters, and vulnerabilities. Recursion is a technique within FFUF to handle nested directories or structures, allowing the tool to explore deeper paths that were found during the fuzzing process. 

Here's an explanation of **recursion strategies** and best practices when using FFUF:

---

### **Key FFUF Options for Recursion**
1. **`-recursion`**  
   Enables recursive scanning. When FFUF finds a directory, it will use the same wordlist to fuzz that directory.

2. **`-recursion-depth <number>`**  
   Specifies how many levels deep FFUF should recursively fuzz. For instance, a depth of `2` means FFUF will go two levels deep into discovered directories.

3. **`-recursion-strategy`**  
   Determines how FFUF decides which paths to recursively fuzz. Common strategies:
   - **`default`**: Recursively fuzz only if the response matches the filters (e.g., status codes, size).
   - **`greedy`**: Always recursively fuzz, regardless of whether the response matches the filters.

4. **Filters (`-fc`, `-fs`, etc.)**  
   Apply filters (e.g., by status code, response size, or word count) to reduce noise. These filters influence what gets recursively fuzzed when combined with the `-recursion-strategy default`.

---

### **Recursion Strategy Recommendations**

#### **1. Default Strategy**
- Best for targeted discovery.
- Use this when you want to avoid unnecessary fuzzing in non-relevant directories.
- Example:
  ```bash
  ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -recursion -recursion-depth 3 -recursion-strategy default -mc 200
  ```
  - Here, FFUF will only recursively fuzz directories that return status code 200.

#### **2. Greedy Strategy**
- Use this when you want comprehensive coverage of all discovered paths, regardless of initial filters.
- Useful in exploratory testing or when dealing with unknown server behavior.
- Example:
  ```bash
  ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -recursion -recursion-depth 3 -recursion-strategy greedy
  ```

#### **3. Combining Filters with Default Strategy**
- Pair `-recursion-strategy default` with filters to focus on directories likely to be valid or interesting.
- Example:
  ```bash
  ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -recursion -recursion-depth 2 -mc 200 -fs 0
  ```
  - Here, FFUF will recursively fuzz only directories that return a 200 status code and avoid empty responses.

### **General Tips**
1. **Choose Depth Carefully**  
   Large recursion depths can significantly increase runtime. Start with 2â€“3 and increase as needed.

2. **Refine Wordlists**  
   Use wordlists tailored for the application or server type to improve results.

3. **Filter Aggressively**  
   Avoid wasting resources by filtering irrelevant responses. Use:
   - `-mc` for matching specific status codes.
   - `-fc` to filter out common responses (e.g., 404).
   - `-fs` to filter by response size.

4. **Save Results**  
   Use the `-o` flag to save the output for analysis:
   ```bash
   ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -recursion -o output.json -of json
   ```

5. **Parallel Fuzzing**  
   Use `-rate` and `-t` options to optimize performance, especially with deeper recursion:
   ```bash
   ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -recursion -t 50 -rate 100
   ```

By understanding these strategies and combining them with intelligent filtering, you can use FFUF's recursion feature effectively for comprehensive web discovery.
